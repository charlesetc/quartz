But if you want to engage with the community instance (or just, not host your own instance) you would have to pay for hosting.\n\nIt will not be legal to host your own instance and charge people for it. I guess it could be possible to buy a license for that?

The idea is to take some notes about what it could be. Each note would represent one feature or aspect of the game.
