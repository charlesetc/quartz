A light breeze, some rays of sunlight, a nip in the air.\n\nI want to take my time. Move through the environment. Listen to the music. And then watch the thoughts bubble up. I could stumble across a post by one of my friends, an essay by someone I follow, or a piece of local news. Things show up on the side of this path. I can walk right by them, or stop, and ponder for a moment. At various points, the path forks, dotted with branches to the unrelated or the only-tangentially-related. I can choose to see more about the theme of a given article, more by the author, or continue along my existing trajectory.\n\nI can always walk through this exact path again. I can see this path on a map of everything I have ever read or explored. \n\nI can create my own paths. I can choose their lighting and scenery. I can leave messages. For myself and others. I can share this path, linking someone else to a starting point for their own walk.\n\nI might run into someone else along the way. In busier parts I would move hurriedly past them. But in the more remote corners, I might welcome a fellow traveler.  We could work together, reading articles, discussing them, even writing them.\n\nI'm not sure what the internet is going to be in 100 years but it's definitely not going to look anything like it does today. Let's make it a place we want to be.","lastmodified":"2022-11-02T16:31:24.670872218Z","tags":null},"/reading":{"title":"Reading","content":"\nSome books I enjoyed reading\n- [The Dawn of Everything](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374157357/thedawnofeverything), David Graeber\n- Form, Function \u0026 Design, Paul Jacques Grillo\n- Company of One, [Paul Jarvis](https://usefathom.com/pjrvs)\n- [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), James Clear\n- [No Is Not Enough](https://www.noisnotenough.org/), Naomi Klein\n- Walkable City, [Jeff Speck](https://www.jeffspeck.com/)\n- [Quiet](https://briefer.com/books/quiet), Susan Cain\n- [Ace](https://www.angelachen.org/ace.html), Angela Chen\n- [An Entangled Life](https://www.merlinsheldrake.com/entangled-life), Merlin Sheldrake\n- [The Death and Life of Great American Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities), Jane Jacobs\n\nSome people who make content I value\n- Ezra Klein ([podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/column/ezra-klein-podcast))\n- Zeynep Tufekci ([blog](https://www.theinsight.org/), among other things)","lastmodified":"2022-11-02T16:31:24.670872218Z","tags":null},"/searchable-paper":{"title":"Searchable Paper","content":"\nPencil and paper is a very versitile combination. You can write, graph, doodle, and shade. You get the tactile pleasure of holding a nice object in your hands and creating something physical right in front of you.\n\nYou can shuffle sheets of paper around on a desk, place them in a stack, or fold one into a paper airplane and send it to someone. Paper is the primary medium for information transfer in the physical world.\n\nRather than having computers replace paper, what if they could expand its possiblities? It seems like handwriting recongition is just getting to a place where a photo of a handwritten page can be parsed into text pretty well. I bet this experience could be improved even further with some training of the ML model on one's own handwriting.\n\nWhat's stopping us from positioning a high relolution cameras above our desks at all times? Then anytime we write down *anything*, a computer could parse the text and track the page it's on. It could maintain a catalog of not only *what* has been written, but *where*. We should be able to search our entire index of handwritten notes and be told exactly how many pages deep in a stack it is.\n\nAnd then publish markdown content from these pages? Editing the website live with an eraser? I'm getting ahead of myself...","lastmodified":"2022-11-02T16:31:24.670872218Z","tags":null},"/software-I-am-dreaming-of":{"title":"Software I'm Dreaming Of","content":"\nSome software I would love to see\n\n[[a stroll through the internet]]\n[[well-worn software]]\n[[searchable paper]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-02T16:31:24.670872218Z","tags":null},"/well-worn-software":{"title":"Well-worn Software","content":"\nWhat would software look like if it aged?\n\nImagine a computing interface that became less and less \"new\" the more you used it. Sculpted to the shape of your hand. Perhaps the mouse cursor on your computer would become rounder in the direction you most frequently drag? Maybe a button could develop a nice shiny patch the more it is used.\n\nEach time you type a character the next becomes a little less perfect? Some gaussian blur or a variable font? A strange result, yes, but yours.\n\nSitting and reading a page in the sun could cause it to slowly yellow. Switching applications too quickly might result in wrinkles or even tears. Each play of a song could cause it to get a bit more crackly?\n\nThe imperfections we find ourselves surrounded by in the physical world aren't something to be driven away or improved by software. They are part of the experience of being human. As software progresses it should be easier to implement these wild fantasies. I hope we do.","lastmodified":"2022-11-02T16:31:24.670872218Z","tags":null}}
