What if codebases are like crystals?

Grow them too quickly, at too high a temperature and they'll become complicated, hard to understand, ugly.

Take care of them, grow them slowly at the right temperature and they'll become beautiful, shinning pillars of thought, with consistent patterns emerging naturally throughout.

But you cannot grow a large crystal from a broken starter. And you cannot make a broken codebase whole.

A careful few know how to coax a single crystal from a mess of shards. Such crystals require constant vigilance, a loving guardian to ward off the chaos.

Beware the endless, whitewater rapids of the void my child: May patience and wisdom grow you tremendous crystals with time.
