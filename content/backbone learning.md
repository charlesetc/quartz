## outline

- people learn well by things they are interested in
- they follow the rod of the their interests into so many spines that broach all sorts of subjects

The term 'backbone' is actually quite indicative of what is going on: there is a specialization of a certain area of knowledge where one's understanding is quite dense, and this leads to dense spears of knowledge that cut through other areas of the knowledge space. 

And given that the knowledge space is very large, it's really hard to get any kind of relatively dense understanding of the entire thing. So these highly interdisciplinary spines are actually really, really good to form because they (a) get you to learn a lot but more importantly (b) over time they form a mycelia-like network through the space, minimizing the distance from any random point in the space to a section where your knowledge is dense.

potential examples: 
* coffee
- flowers
- cooking
- ships sinking

takeaways:
- subjects are a lie
- this is now how things are *ever* taught in school because they are inherently incredibly specialized to the individual

## draft

Consider for a second all human knowledge. We can think of it as a high-dimensional vector space; each piece of knowledge represents a point in the space and distance between two points is measured by how "related" they are.

Take two concepts: food and cars. How food-y are cars? How car-y is food? We might think, "Hey, these are pretty unrelated concepts". They should be far apart in this high-dimensional space of human knowledge, right? But then you learn about food trucks. And wow! Food trucks are very related to food and they are very related to cars. So we can travel from food to cars by traveling two short distances: first to food trucks and then to cars. Suddenly food and cars don't seem so far after all! 

I would argue that this space is *highly* interconnected.  That the distance from any one object to any other object is not very large, despite concepts feeling far apart. They feel far apart to us because we have categories that we can classify things in and they might fall into different categories. Or maybe they feel far apart because we are used to an even smaller distance measure.

Imagine, if you will, this space of hyper connected knowledge points as a three dimensional graph. Tons of points in the graph, lots of lines going everywhere. When I tell you that everything is 'close' to each other in this space, you might shrink it in your mind to represent that. Cool. But the axes we use are arbitrary so 'zoom in' a ton if you will for me. Look at a particular piece of the mesh.

*Now* we are looking at knowledge. Seeing the structure of it!
