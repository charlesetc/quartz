Welcome!
This is my digital garden.
It just so happens to be a forest.
As you hike, you take a moment to look around you.
You contemplate the fog passing around the trees.
You take it all in.

I hope you find what you came for.
I've left some trinkets around these woods.
Maybe you'll find one is a gem?
