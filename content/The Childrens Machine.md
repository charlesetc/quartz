> *"The Children's Machine" is an excellent book by Seymour Papert that inspired this thought.*

Children are extremely good at learning. They learn so much all the time, ~~even~~ *especially* before they start school. Children can be *enriched* and I think this is *valuable*
 
Children learn in two ways. They spend time walking around the world, seeing things, and putting things in their mouths. This is direct evidence-gathering.
