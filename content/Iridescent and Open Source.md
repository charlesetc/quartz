I would like [[Iridescent]] to be open source. Or at least "source available". I would like anyone to be able to run it for free. If you want to host your own instance, sure. But if you want to engage with the community instance (or just, not host your own instance) you would have to pay for hosting.

It will not be legal to host your own instance and charge people for it. I guess it could be possible to buy a license for that? But I doubt people would want to do that.
