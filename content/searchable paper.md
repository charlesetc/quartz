Pencil and paper is a very versitile combination. You can write, graph, doodle, and shade. You get the tactile pleasure of holding a nice object in your hands and creating something physical right in front of you.

You can shuffle sheets of paper around on a desk, place them in a stack, or fold one into a paper airplane and send it to someone. Paper is the primary medium for information transfer in the physical world.

Rather than having computers replace paper, what if they could expand its possiblities? It seems like handwriting recongition is just getting to a place where a photo of a handwritten page can be parsed into text pretty well. I bet this experience could be improved even further with some training of the ML model on one's own handwriting.

What's stopping us from positioning a high relolution cameras above our desks at all times? Then anytime we write down *anything*, a computer could parse the text and track the page it's on. It could maintain a catalog of not only *what* has been written, but *where*. We should be able to search our entire index of handwritten notes and be told exactly how many pages deep in a stack it is.

And then publish markdown content from these pages? Editing the website live with an eraser? I'm getting ahead of myself...
