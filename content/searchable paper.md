Pencil and paper is a very versatile combination. You can write, graph, doodle, and shade. You get the tactile pleasure of holding a nice object in your hands and creating something physical right in front of you.

You can shuffle sheets of paper around on a desk, place them in a stack, or fold one into a paper airplane and send it to someone. Paper is the primary medium for information transfer in the physical world.

Rather than having computers replace paper, what if they could expand its possiblities? It seems like handwriting recongition is just getting to a place where a photo of a handwritten page can be parsed into text pretty well. I bet this experience could be improved even further with some training of the ML model on one's own handwriting.

What's stopping us from positioning a high resolution camera above our desks at all times? Now when we write down *anything*, a computer could parse the text and track the page it's on. It could maintain a catalog of not only *what* has been written, but *where*. We should be able to search our entire index of handwritten notes to get a list of related pages back. Want to find a particular page? The system could tell us not only the coordinates but how pages deep in a stack it is.

Where can we go from here? Serving markdown content right from these pages? Editing a website with an eraser? How about your whole backend?

This is an interface I would love to use to interact with the digital world. I look forward to the day it exists.
