What would a stroll through the internet be?

I think the scenery should be nice. A light breeze, some rays of sunlight, a nip in the air.

I want to take my time. Move through the environment. Listen to the music. And then watch the thoughts bubble up. I could stumble across a post by one of my friends, an essay by someone I follow, or a piece of local news. Things show up on the side of this path. I can walk right by them, or stop, and ponder for a moment. At various points, the path forks. I can choose to see more about the theme of a given article, more by the author, or continue along my existing trajectory. The path could be dotted with branches to the unrelated or the only-tangentially-related along the way.

I can always walk through this exact path again. I can see this path on a map of everything I have ever read or explored. 

I can create my own paths. I can choose their lighting and scenery. I can leave messages. For myself and others. I can share this path, linking someone else for a starting point to their walk.

I might run into someone else along this path. In busier parts I would move hurriedly past them. But in the more remote corners, I might welcome a fellow traveler.  We could work together, reading articles, discussing them, even writing them.
